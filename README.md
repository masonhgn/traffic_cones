# Traffic Cone Chaos (2D python game)
Simple 2D game using python with the pygame library. The player spawns on the ground, in the middle of the screen, and can use A,D and Space to move and jump. As soon as the game is launched, traffic cones start falling out of the sky. It is the player's job to avoid contact with those traffic cones as they fall from the sky. From this project, I learned a lot about object oriented programming concepts, proper formatting to allow for efficient debugging later on, and specific game related things like how to integrate physics for the player.
